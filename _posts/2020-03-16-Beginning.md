This is my first page of Github.
I have started to study Python, Java, MySQL, html/css just a couple of months ago.
This is my first time to use Github.... I'm working on this for hours. I hope it works well this time!!

I would record my studying history of Python, Java, MySQL, and hopefully Machine Learning and data structure as time goes.
Hope anyone else who just started to study programming like me could find helful in my studing logs.
