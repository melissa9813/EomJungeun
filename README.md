## Welcome to Jungeun (Melissa)'s Github Pages

I'm currently studying several programming languages. I'm planning to study data mining and machine learning.
Python, Java, MySQL are what I'm currently working on, and I'm also studying really basic level of machine learning.

Hope people who are trying to begin to study programmings from nothing like me could find helpful in this pages.
I will record my studying history from now on; it might be really basic....

I would like to pursue my studying so that I can finally master machine learning within years. (I'm a college freshman so hopefully by my senior years)

Following are my process. 

### Python

Finished the basic syntax.
Planning to solve a bunch of problems to practice.
Planning to start learning numpy and pandas next month.

### Java
Currently studying and solving the java basic problems.

### MySQL
Finsihed studying the basic syntax of MySQL.
Planning to study the advanced level.
Planning to working on real-world problem in two months.

### Machine Learning
Just began to study "Hands-on Machine Learnign with Scikit-Learn & Tensorflow"
Hard to understand for me with basic level of Python.
Will repeat this book several times.
